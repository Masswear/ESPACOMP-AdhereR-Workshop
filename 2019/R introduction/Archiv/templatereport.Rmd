## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown report of my first analysis in R. version 2....

I first upload my environment:

```{r upload}
load("my1stEnvironment.RData")
```

This is the little dataset I created earlier: 

```{r dataset}
respondents.scores
```

... and I can print it as a table if I load the knitr package (and hide the code I use)

```{r , results = 'asis', echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
if(!require(knitr)){install.packages("knitr")}
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(respondents.scores)
```


I can also embed plots, for example these are the IQ scores of the 4 respondents in my dataset:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(respondents.scores$IQ)
```

... and I am just getting started :)
